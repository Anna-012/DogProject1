        <h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
        <p>The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance 
            to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, 
            known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, 
            the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited 
            agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent 
            and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</p>
